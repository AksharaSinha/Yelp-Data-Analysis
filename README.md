# Yelp-Data-Analysis
In this project, Yelp reviews datasets have been analysed by using structured queries, machine learning models for making predictions, and a topic modelling algorithm.


The solution concept is based on using Spark SQL for querying data, distributed implementation of machine learning algorithms for making predictions, and using LDA for topic modelling. 


The implementation is based on using PySpark, writing various queries using Spark DataFrame API, developing a pipeline for machine learning using Spark ML, and using LDA for topic modelling by using implementation available in Spark ML. Several other libraries are also used, in particular, for natural language processing and data visualisation. 


The dataset consists of a publicly available Yelp Reviews Dataset, which comprises of 4 JSON files, containing information about businesses, reviews, users, and other information. The dataset contains information for around 2M unique users and around 200K unique businesses.
